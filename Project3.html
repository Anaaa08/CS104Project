    <p>(Science, Technology, Engineering And Mathematics)</p>
    <p class="a">Women represent 50% of the US population. Yet, women make up less than one third of the nationâ€™s STEM workforce.</p>
    <p class="a">So</p>
    <p class="a">Our mission is to create a community of professional women in STEM where they can share experiences, knowledge, and career opportunities.</p>

        <p>We want to make women in STEM visible. We seek to inspire new generations and empower female professionals in these areas, with the goal of creating 
            a community and promoting gender equality in the scientific and technological fields. By providing women with this information and resources,
