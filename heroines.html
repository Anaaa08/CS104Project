            <p>Marie Curie's relentless resolve and
                insatiable curiosity made her an icon
                in the world of modern science.
                Indefatigable despite a career of
                physically demanding and ultimately
                fatal work, she discovered polonium
                and radium, championed the use of
                radiation in medicine and
                fundamentally changed our
                understanding of radioactivity.

             <p>Cecilia Rodriguez Aragon is an American computer scientist, professor, author, and champion aerobatic pilot who is best known as the co-inventor (with Raimund Seidel) of the treap data structure, a type of binary search tree that orders nodes by adding a priority as well as a key to each node. She is also known for her work in data- intensive science and visual analytics of very large data sets, for which she received the prestigious Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE).</p>
