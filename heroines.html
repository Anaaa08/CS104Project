         <h4>(Marie Curie in her laboratory, 1925)</h4>
         <p>Marie Curie's relentless resolve and
            insatiable curiosity made her an icon
            in the world of modern science.
            Indefatigable despite a career of
            physically demanding and ultimately
            fatal work, she discovered polonium
            and radium, championed the use of
            radiation in medicine and
            fundamentally changed our
            understanding of radioactivity.

             <p>Cecilia Rodriguez Aragon is an American computer scientist, professor, author, and champion aerobatic pilot who is best known as the co-inventor (with Raimund Seidel) of the treap data structure, a type of binary search tree that orders nodes by adding a priority as well as a key to each node. She is also known for her work in data- intensive science and visual analytics of very large data sets, for which she received the prestigious Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE).</p>
